## Highlights
### What is Zero-Knowledge (like, actually)? w/ David Wong
In this module, Nicolas Mohnblatt and David Wong dig into the term “Zero Knowledge” and discuss what this property actually is, when it is being used (or not) and what characteristics some systems need in order to be considered truly ZK. They then highlight the different types of ZK — perfect, statistical, and computational –, discuss the distinction between dishonest and honest verifiers, and the preference for adaptive models over non-adaptive ones. Additionally, they explore methods for generating hiding commitments from techniques such as KZG, Pedersen, and hashes, and conclude with an overview of the zero-knowledge analysis of PLONK.
