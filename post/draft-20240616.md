## Papers
### Polymath: Groth16 Is Not The Limit
Proposes a zk-SNARK Polymath for the Square Arithmetic Programming constraint system using the KZG polynomial commitment scheme.  Polymath has a shorter argument than Groth16.  At 192-bit security, Polymath's argument is nearly half the size, making it highly competitive for high-security future applications.
