### On Proving Pairings - Andrija Novakovic
This paper explores efficient ways to prove correctness of elliptic curve pairing relations. First shows that the final exponentiation step of pairing verification can be replaced with a more efficient “residue check,” which can be incorporated into the Miller loop. Then shows how to reduce the cost of the Miller loop by precomputing all the necessary lines, and how this is especially efficient when the second pairing argument is fixed in advance. Instantiateing algorithms and show results for the BN254 curve.

### Dark Pools
Dark Pool 是一种私密的交易平台，允许投资者（通常是机构投资者）在公开市场上未显示的价格进行大宗交易。这种设置的主要目的是减少大宗交易对市场价格的影响，即减少市场滑点和价格波动，同时保护交易策略的隐私。推荐两篇文章：
