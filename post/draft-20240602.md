### The first ZKP Verify Code Implementation using Bitcoin Script

Zulu Network team has Open-Sourced the first ZKP Verify Code Implementation using Bitcoin Script, involving mainstream algorithms such as Groth16/FFlonk. This achievement lays the foundation for constructing a decentralized bridge based on BitVM2. It is based on the **On Proving Parings** paper whch significantly reduces the overall script size.

## Updates

### Plonkish Constraint Systems

As part of the ZKProof standardization effort, the Plonkish Constraint System Working Group is developing a specification, a reference implementation written in Rust, and test vectors for Plonkish arithmetisation.

### On Proving Pairings - Andrija Novakovic

This paper explores efficient ways to prove correctness of elliptic curve pairing relations. First shows that the final exponentiation step of pairing verification can be replaced with a more efficient “residue check,” which can be incorporated into the Miller loop. Then shows how to reduce the cost of the Miller loop by precomputing all the necessary lines, and how this is especially efficient when the second pairing argument is fixed in advance. Instantiateing algorithms and show results for the BN254 curve.

### zkLLM: Zero Knowledge Proofs for Large Language Models

Standing as the inaugural specialized zero-knowledge proof tailored for LLMs to the best of our knowledge. Presenting **tlookup**, a parallelized lookup argument designed for non-arithmetic tensor operations in deep learning, offering a solution with no asymptotic overhead. Introducing **zkAttn**, a specialized zero-knowledge proof crafted for the attention mechanism, carefully balancing considerations of running time, memory usage, and accuracy.
