## Papers
### Resettable Statistical Zero-Knowledge for NP
Showing an equivalence of resettable statistical zero-knowledge arguments for NP and witness encryption schemes for NP.

### Zero-knowledge IOPs Approaching Witness Length
Constructing the first ZK-IOPs approaching the witness length for a natural NP problem. More specifically, designs constant-query and constant-round IOPs for 3SAT.

### The Brave New World of Global Generic Groups and UC-Secure Zero-Overhead SNARKs
Establishing the UC security of Groth16 without any significant overhead. Providing a general framework for proving protocols secure in the presence of global generic groups, which then applys to Groth16.
