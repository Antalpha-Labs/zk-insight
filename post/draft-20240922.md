## Highlights
### Friends don’t let friends reuse nonces
This blog post tells a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when implementing a relatively basic type of cryptography: a bidirectional encrypted channel, such as an encrypted voice call or encrypted chat. We’ll explore how more subtle issues of this type can arise in a network with several encrypted channels, and we’ll describe a bug we discovered in a client’s threshold signature scheme.
