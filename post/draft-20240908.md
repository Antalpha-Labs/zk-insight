## Highlights
### quantum punks
Our main thesis is that a small yet growing field called Quantum Cryptography can:
1) lead to new cryptographic protocols that we could not build with classical cryptography
2) be accelerationist for the broader quantum industry
   
Even more so, a small movement of people beyond us, believe that there could be more cypherpunk applications of quantum technology that we have yet to discover.
We wrote this short doc to create awareness of what is possible and to gather like-minded people to build this future.

### Preserving Reality: The Crucial Role of Attestation in Anti-FakeAI.
TL;DR:Cryptography emerges as the primary defense against this threat, with attestation serving as a crucial mechanism to ensure content authenticity and validate human involvement. This article provides an in-depth exploration of attestation, including its definitions, challenges, and proposed solutions.
