### Epistle: Elastic Succinct Arguments for Plonk Constraint System
Presents Epistle, an elastic SNARK for Plonk constraint system. For an instance with size $N$, in the time-efficient configuration, the prover uses $O_\lambda(N)$ cryptographic operations and $O(N)$ memory; in the space-efficient configuration, the prover uses $O_\lambda(N \log N)$ cryptographic operations and $O(\log N)$ memory. Compared to Gemini, this approach reduces the asymptotic time complexity of the space-efficient prover by a factor of $\log N$. The key technique we use is to make the toolbox for multivariate PIOP provided by HyperPlonk elastic.

### Collaborative, Segregated NIZK (CoSNIZK) and More Efficient Lattice-Based Direct Anonymous Attestation
Defines collaborative, segregated, non-interactive zero knowledge (CoSNIZK). This notion generalizes the property of collaborative zero-knowledge so that the zero-knowledge property need only apply to a subset of provers during collaborative proof generation. The main contribution is the construction of a DAA based on the hardness of problems over module lattices as well as the ISISf assumption.
