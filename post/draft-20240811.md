## Papers
### Optimizing Big Integer Multiplication on Bitcoin: Introducing w-windowed Approach
Inspired by Elliptic Curve scalar multiplication, this paper introduces the 
w-windowed method for multiplying two numbers. We outperform state-of-the-art approaches, including BitVM’s implementation. Finally, we also show how the windowed method can lead to optimizations not only in big integer arithmetic solely but in more general arithmetic problems.
