## Learnings
### Cryptography 101 : Kyber and Dilithium
Video lectures for Alfred Menezes's introductory course on Kyber-KEM and the Dilithium signature scheme. These lattice-based cryptographic scheme were standardized by NIST on August 13, 2024.

### Cryptography 101: Error-Correcting Codes
This course is an introduction to algebraic methods for devising error-correcting codes. These codes are used, for example, in satellite broadcasts, CD/DVD/Blu-ray players, memory chips, two-dimensional bar codes (including QR codes), and digital video broadcasting. The mathematical ingredients for the course are linear algebra, elementary number theory (integers modulo n and congruences), and abstract algebra (groups, rings, ideals, and finite fields).
