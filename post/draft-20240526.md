### Speeding Up Multi-Scalar Multiplications for Pairing-Based zkSNARKs
Revisiting the recent precomputation-based MSM calculation method proposed by Luo, Fu and Gong at CHES 2023 and generalize their approach, presented a general construction of optimal buckets. This improvement leads to significant performance improvements.

### More Embedded Curves for SNARK-Pairing-Friendly Curves
Showing how the problem of finding families of embedded curves is related to the problem of finding optimal formulas for subgroup membership testing on the pairing-friendly curve side. Then apply Smith's technique and Dai, Lin, Zhao, and Zhou criteria to obtain the formulas of embedded curves with KSS, and outline a generic algorithm for solving this problem in all cases; Provide two families of embedded curves for KSS18 and give examples of cryptographic size.

### Breaking Verifiable Delay Functions in the Random Oracle Model
Showing that VDFs with imperfect completeness and non-adaptive computational uniqueness cannot be constructed in the pure random oracle model (without additional computational assumptions).
