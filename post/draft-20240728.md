## Updates
### How to Construct Infinite Sets
We will develop various tools in set theory, like ordered pairs, relations, ordering, and equivalence classes, to begin with only zero, and from nothing, build all of the real numbers.

### The BLAKE3 Hashing Framework
Internet-Draft submitted! A formal standardized specification is a requirement for certain systems and organizations (for ex., OpenSSL). We hope the IETF crypto working group recognizes the value and adoption of BLAKE3.

### Solvability of linear systems over finite fields
If you have n equations in n unknowns over a finite field with q elements, how likely is it that the system of equations has a solution?

### Starkware’s Stwo prover now can prove 620,000 hashes in a second with Circle STARKs
They measured throughput for proving invocations of the Poseidon2 hash over M31 field on a MacPro M3.

### ZkBoost: Proof Supply Chain Abstraction
Gevulot announced ZkBoost, which can connect all proof networks such as proof marketplaces, prover networks and proof aggregators.

### Warlock open-sourced new linear algebra library Noether in Rust.
Noether provides traits and blanket implementations for algebraic structures, from basic ones like magmas to more complex ones like fields. It leans heavily on the basic traits available in std::ops and num_traits.
