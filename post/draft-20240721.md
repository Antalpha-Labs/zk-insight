## Highlights
### Pairings for the Rest of Us
In this article, we covered the foundational concepts for understanding elliptic curve pairings over field extensions, focusing on the Frobenius endomorphism and the Trace map to identify subgroups $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$ and implemented the Tate pairing step-by-step.

### sigma0-polymath
This is the first (as far as we know) implementation of the non-universal zk-SNARK described in the paper Polymath: Groth16 Is Not The Limit by Helger Lipmaa.

### coCircom: Collaborative Circom
coCircom is a tool for building coSNARKs, a new technology that enables multiple distrusting parties to collaboratively compute a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). It leverages the existing domain-specific language circom to define arithmetic circuits. With coCircom, all existing circom circuits can be promoted to coSNARKs without any modification to the original circuit. Additionally, coCircom is fully compatible with the Groth16 backend of snarkjs, the native proofing system for circom. Proofs built with coCircom can be verified using snarkjs, and vice versa.

### Nexus 2.0: Jolt, HyperNova, and a New SDK
A new prover frontend, powered by the Jolt arithmetization system
A new prover backend, powered by the HyperNova recursive proof system
The Nexus SDK, a programmatic framework for producing multiple proofs in parallel and at scale
- <https://blog.nexus.xyz/nexus-2-0-jolt-hypernova-and-a-new-sdk/>

A key component of the Nexus 2.0 zkVM is a new SDK, a programmatic framework for computing multiple zkVM proofs at scale. It supports each of our Nova, HyperNova, and Jolt backends, enabling easy configuration to tailor proving to specific applications. Dynamic compilation, private input, public output, and logging support together provide a rich programmatic interface to guest programs. A simple, misuse-resistant design makes using the Nexus zkVM to prove even complex programs a straightforward process.

### A Crack in the Firmament: Restoring Soundness of the Orion Proof System and More
Orion in its current revision is still unsound (with and without the zero-knowledge property) and demonstrates practical attacks on it. Then show how to repair Orion without additional assumptions, which requies non-trivial fixes when aiming to preserve the linear time prover complexity.

### Dot-Product Proofs and Their Applications
A dot-product proof (DPP) is a simple probabilistic proof system in which the input statement $\mathbf{x}$ and the proof $\pi$ are vectors over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, and the proof is verified by making a single dot-product query $\langle\mathbf{q},(\mathbf{x} \| \boldsymbol{\pi})\rangle$ jointly to $\mathbf{x}$ and $\pi$. A DPP can be viewed as a 1-query fully linear PCP. We study the feasibility and efficiency of DPPs.

### Designated-Verifier zk-SNARKs Made Easy
Propose a construction of strong designated-verifier zk-SNARKs. The construction inspired by designated verifier signatures based on two-party ring signatures does not use encryption and can be applied on any public-verifiable zk-SNARKs to yield a designated-verifiable variant.

### On cycles of pairing-friendly abelian varieties
One of the most promising avenues for realising scalable proof systems relies on the existence of 2-cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. In this paper, the authors generalise the notion of cycles of pairing-friendly elliptic curves to study cycles of pairing-friendly abelian varieties, with a view towards realising more efficient pairing based SNARKs.
