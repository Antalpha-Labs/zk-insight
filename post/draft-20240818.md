### Lemma: ZK Theorem Proving
Lemma is a ZK theorem proving framework that enables individuals to post unsolved theorem definitions accompanied by a bounty for anyone that can submit a valid Mathematical proof which solves the theorem. These proofs are validated on chain, and the bounties are trustlessly released to the solver.

### Galois Theory Notes
The author has arXived their Galois theory course notes from 2021-2023, making them publicly available along with other course materials. The author notes that the Galois theory notes have been particularly popular, possibly due to their visually appealing format with color and icons.
