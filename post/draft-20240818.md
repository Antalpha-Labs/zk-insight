### Lemma: ZK Theorem Proving
Lemma is a ZK theorem proving framework that enables individuals to post unsolved theorem definitions accompanied by a bounty for anyone that can submit a valid Mathematical proof which solves the theorem. These proofs are validated on chain, and the bounties are trustlessly released to the solver.

### Cryptographic Right Answers: Post Quantum Edition
The post-quantum cryptography (PQC) landscape is complex and challenging, with new algorithms and standards emerging, such as Kyber, Dilithium, and SPHINCS+, which offer improved security against quantum attacks. To navigate this landscape, developers should prioritize using established cryptographic libraries, avoiding custom implementations, and focusing on hybrid schemes.

## Learnings
### Abstract Algebra Online Course
Abstract Algebra deals with groups, rings, fields, and modules. These are abstract structures which appear in many different branches of mathematics, including geometry, number theory, topology, and more. They even appear in scientific topics such as quantum mechanics.

### Galois Theory Notes
The author has arXived their Galois theory course notes from 2021-2023, making them publicly available along with other course materials. The author notes that the Galois theory notes have been particularly popular, possibly due to their visually appealing format with color and icons.
