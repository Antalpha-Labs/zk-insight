### Designing high-performance zkVMs
This article is a deep-dive into proof system design for zkVMs, split into two parts.

In Part 1, we give a high-level overview of the proof system that underlies RISC Zero’s zkVM, and what’s on our horizon for improving zkVM performance.

In Part 2, we’ll take a closer look at each layer of the proof system, touching on design considerations with respect to innovations such as folding schemes, JOLT, Binius, and Circle STARKs.

### A Note on Ligero and Logarithmic Randomness
This is a short note which explains how Ligero works in the framework of "succinct proofs and linear algebra" and how we can view it as a *beautifully* simple protocol for succinct proofs of matrix-vector multiplication!

## Updates
### Yuval Ishai: Dot-Product Proofs
A dot-product proof is a simple probabilistic proof system in which the verifier decides whether to accept an input vector based on a single linear combination of the entries of the input and a proof vector. I will present constructions of linear-size dot-product proofs for circuit satisfiability and discuss two kinds of applications: exponential-time hardness of approximation of MAX-LIN from ETH, and minimizing verification complexity of succinct arguments.
