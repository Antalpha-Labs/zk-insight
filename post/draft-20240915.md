## Highlights
### What Does It Mean To Know?
ZK- proofs are one of crypto's greatest advancements. But "knowledge" has been studied by philosophers for 1000s of years. In this post, I compare the “justified true belief” theory of knowledge with the specification of knowledge implied by ZK-proofs

### Two Vulnerabilities in gnark's Groth16 Proofs

### Designing high-performance zkVMs
This article is a deep-dive into proof system design for zkVMs, split into two parts.

In Part 1, we give a high-level overview of the proof system that underlies RISC Zero’s zkVM, and what’s on our horizon for improving zkVM performance.

In Part 2, we’ll take a closer look at each layer of the proof system, touching on design considerations with respect to innovations such as folding schemes, JOLT, Binius, and Circle STARKs.

### Introducing zkDL++ 
A cutting-edge framework for proving the integrity of any deep neural network.

### Provable Watermark Extraction
zkDL++ is a novel framework designed for provable AI. Leveraging zkDL++, we address a key challenge in generative AI watermarking: Maintaining privacy while ensuring provability. By enhancing the watermarking system developed by Meta, zkDL++ solves the problem of needing to keep watermark extractors private to avoid attacks, offering a more secure solution. Beyond watermarking, zkDL++ proves the integrity of any deep neural network (DNN) with high efficiency.

## Updates
### Yuval Ishai: Dot-Product Proofs
A dot-product proof is a simple probabilistic proof system in which the verifier decides whether to accept an input vector based on a single linear combination of the entries of the input and a proof vector. I will present constructions of linear-size dot-product proofs for circuit satisfiability and discuss two kinds of applications: exponential-time hardness of approximation of MAX-LIN from ETH, and minimizing verification complexity of succinct arguments.

### Quang Dao: Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge from LPN and MQ
We give the first construction of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments from post-quantum assumptions other than Learning with Errors. In particular, we achieve NIZK under the polynomial hardness of the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption, and the exponential hardness of solving random under-determined multivariate quadratic equations (MQ). We also construct NIZK satisfying statistical zero-knowledge assuming a new variant of LPN, Dense-Sparse LPN, introduced by Dao and Jain (CRYPTO 2024), together with exponentially-hard MQ.
