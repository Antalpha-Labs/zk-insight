## Highlights

### zkSNARKs in the ROM with Unconditional UC-Security 
This paper proves that there exist zkSNARKs in the random oracle model (ROM) that unconditionally achieve UC-security.

### Relativized Succinct Arguments in the ROM Do Not Exist 
This paper proves that relativized succinct arguments in the ROM do not exist. The impossibility holds even if the succinct argument is interactive, and even if soundness is computational (rather than statistical). Relativized SNARGs are a powerful primitive that, e.g., can be used to obtain constructions of IVC (incrementally-verifiable computation) and PCD (proof-carrying data) based on falsifiable cryptographic assumptions. This results rule out this approach for IVC and PCD in the ROM.
