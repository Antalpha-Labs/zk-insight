## Highlights

### Is Telegram really an encrypted messaging app?
Apropos Pavel Durov’s arrest, cryptographer Matthew Green wrote a short post about whether Telegram is an “encrypted messaging app”. The TL;DR here is that Telegram has an optional end-to-end encryption mode that you have to turn on manually. It only works for individual conversations, not for group chats.

### Zirgen Circuit Compiler
Zirgen is a compiler for a domain-specific language, also called "zirgen", which creates arithmetic circuits for the RISC Zero proof system.

## Updates
### A major breakthrough in multiplication over Bitcoin, and in STARK verification on Bitcoin signet
A new algorithm for M31 multiplication reduces multiplication cost by 70%. Unlike STARKs, this new multiplication algorithm (like the previous algorithm) does not require OP_CAT, cementing M31’s status as a Bitcoin-friendly prime, regardless of OP_CAT.

## Learnings
### Foundations and Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs
The workshop will cover several topics within this field, including classical results, interactive oracle proofs, proof from symmetric primitives, group and pairing-based proof systems such as ZK-SNARKs, lattice-based proof systems, and real-world applications.
