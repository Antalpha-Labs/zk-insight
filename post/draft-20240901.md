## Highlights

### Is Telegram really an encrypted messaging app?
Apropos Pavel Durov’s arrest, cryptographer Matthew Green wrote a short post about whether Telegram is an “encrypted messaging app”. The TL;DR here is that Telegram has an optional end-to-end encryption mode that you have to turn on manually. It only works for individual conversations, not for group chats.

## Updates
### A major breakthrough in multiplication over Bitcoin, and in STARK verification on Bitcoin signet
A new algorithm for M31 multiplication reduces multiplication cost by 70%. Unlike STARKs, this new multiplication algorithm (like the previous algorithm) does not require OP_CAT, cementing M31’s status as a Bitcoin-friendly prime, regardless of OP_CAT.
